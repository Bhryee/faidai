Faidai is an application that aims to prevent the application of wrong treatment methods in emergency situations due to misconceptions among the public and to spread correct first aid awareness in the society. Our application includes sections where users can receive first aid trainings and provide the necessary first aid instructions by identifying the type of injury through the images taken with the camera.
